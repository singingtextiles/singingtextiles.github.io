              </h2>
              <p>Artist and researcher, works with textile assemblages and embroideries, sound art, digital media, interactive programming/art, and video. Her work is, in essence, complex: she begins by exploring the limits of the sensorial experience, in order to examine notions of interpretation, translation and misrepresentation from a political-mediatic perspective to end up generating trans-sensory experiences where distortions transform and deform the initial audiovisual patterns, a process that serves as tool to question cultural clashes and expose the hierarchies that conform our
social fabric.

</p>
              
             <p> Ripped fabrics and soft sculptures tell us stories that have remained incomplete until now. Paola Torres, by
reintroducing these silenced voices, fills up this void by embedding them back  in textile frameworks whose looms,
subsequently automated, served to inspire the first computer model. Through
the emphasis on the designs that encode memories since immemorial times in patterns, Torres
refers to the structure of the mind beyond culture; to the physical brain configuration that
is shared by us all, whose perceptual experience will make us see the same patterns again
and again, during that same human history that only a few seem to have claimed as their own. </p>
              <p class="mb-0">Contemporary technology and pre-Columbian worldviews intertwine: part of her
research involces the development of textile controllers and soft sculptures with
haptic and sonic characteristics, where concept, interface and multi-sensory experience are
integrated in layers of both virtual and physical codes, embedded in handicrafted materials
that end up recontextualized and endowed with novel properties, as in
her series of works that involve smart textiles. The use of ancient techniques goes in
hand of the developing of innovative works of art that question the prevailing human history that
attributes to the West and to the male the apparent exclusivity regarding the origins of the
computer and telecommunications, placing different human knowledge
in a hierarchical order, where indigenous thought - one who sees the earth as a mother,
vision never needed more than by now - is taken as "primitive" and inferior and characteristics as
fragility or softness, associated with the feminine, are considered, under this same look, as
qualities without greater utility, as a weakness or an error.
